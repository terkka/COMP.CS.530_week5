Fine-Tuning Phi-2: README

Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Phi-2 model using a structured Jupyter Notebook. The process includes dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and error resolution.

Model Details

Base Model: Phi-2

Training Framework: PyTorch / Hugging Face Transformers

Dataset: Custom dataset for fine-tuning, ensuring optimal performance for the target domain.

Training Objective: Optimize performance on a specific task through supervised fine-tuning.

Error Fixes

The following fixes were applied to resolve encountered issues during execution:

Rouge Score Retrieval: The method rouge_score.__version__ was not functional. Instead, the correct method importlib.metadata.version("rouge_score") was used to retrieve the package version.

Evaluation

The fine-tuned model was assessed based on key performance metrics, such as:

Loss function tracking: Ensured smooth convergence during training.

Rouge Score Analysis: Measured text similarity performance.

Perplexity Analysis: Used as a benchmark for language model performance.

Running the Notebook

To execute the fine-tuning workflow:

Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Load the Jupyter Notebook and execute cells sequentially.

Monitor loss and performance metrics to validate improvements.

Future Improvements

Fine-tune on a larger dataset for better generalization.

Optimize hyperparameters for improved efficiency.

Experiment with additional evaluation techniques to refine results.
